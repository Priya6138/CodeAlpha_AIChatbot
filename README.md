# Artificial Intelligence Chatbot (Java)

This project is the implementation of a Rule-Based Chatbot developed using Java.
It was completed as Task 3 of the CodeAlpha Java Programming Internship.

## Task 3 Objectives

This chatbot is designed to achieve the following:

* Interactive Communication: Create an application for real-time conversation.
* Rule-Based Logic: Implement logic (like if/else or HashMap) to generate context-appropriate responses based on user input.
* Handle Queries: Manage basic greetings, common questions, and provide a fallback response for unknown queries.
* Interface: Utilizes a Console-based / GUI interface for user interaction.

## Technologies Used

* Language: Java Programming
* Core Concepts: Conditional Statements, String Manipulation, Data Structures (e.g., Maps/Lists), and I/O (Input/Output).

## File Structure

The project logic is divided into two main files:

1.  SimpleChatbot.java: Contains the main application loop, handles user input, and displays the conversation.
2.  AIChatbot.java: Contains the core rule-based logic, response dictionary, and methods responsible for generating the chatbot's replies.

## How to Run the Application

### Prerequisites
You must have the Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your system.

### Steps
1.  Download: Download the complete repository (both .java files).
2.  Compile: Navigate to the folder in your command line and compile both Java files:
    bash
    javac .java
    
3.  Run: Execute the main class:
    bash
    java ChatbotGUI 
    
4. The graphical chat window will open, allowing you to start your conversation with the AI Chatbot!
